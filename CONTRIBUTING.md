Contributing to the CoronaWhy Vaccines and Therapeutics Task
=======================

Welcome
-------

Welcome to the team! The CoronaWhy V&T (Vaccines and Therapeutics) Task Force is excited to have you be part of this incredible crowd sourced effort to better understand and synthesize COVID-19-related literature. The mission of our task force is to answer the CORD-19 Kaggle task: "What do we know about Vaccines and Therapeutics being considered for COVID-19 treatment?" 

Everyone is welcome to contribute code via pull requests, file issues on GitHub, add to our documentation, or to help out in any other way. We grant commit access (which includes full rights to the issue database, such as being able to edit labels) to people who have communicated with the leaders of the CoronaWhy V&T task force. If you are interested in getting involved ping @dnsosa in the CoronaWhy slack team.

We will be communicating primarily through the Slack #task-vt channel. Project management/task delegation will be visible on the team's Trello board (ping @dnsosa to get access to that).

Your hard work is invaluable in making quick, actionable progress on understanding the state of the world with regard to the combatting this terrible pandemic. THANK YOU.


Contributing code to the V&T task
----------------------

To ensure that everyone is able to:
1. Meaningfully contribute to this effort,
2. Avoid doing redundant work, and
3. See what everyone else is working on,

we will be using GitHub to maintain a centralized body of code and incorporate everyones hard work. As such, we'll try to keep things as standardized as much as possible (which is maybe slightly different than in the typical Kaggle style).

Please get yourselves acquainted with the following documents in order to get started:

1. [Our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which stipulates explicitly
   that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and professional. This
   also documents our conflict resolution policy and encourages people
   to ask questions.

2. [Values](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Values),
   which talks about what we care most about.

3. [Tree hygiene](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Tree-hygiene),
   which covers how to land a PR, how to do code review, how to
   handle breaking changes, how to handle regressions, and how to
   handle post-commit test failures.

4. [Issue hygiene](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Issue-hygiene),
   which covers our processes around triaging bugs, escalating high
   priority bugs, assigning bugs, and our GitHub labels and
   milestones.

5. [Our style guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo),
   which includes advice for designing APIs for Flutter, and how to
   format code in the framework.

6. [Flutter design doc template](https://flutter.dev/go/template),
   which should be used when proposing a new technical design.  This is a good
   practice to do before coding more intricate changes.

In addition to the above, there are many pages on [our Wiki](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/) that may be of interest. For a curated list of pages see the sidebar on the wiki's home page. They are more or less listed in order of importance.


Thanks again for getting involved! Your hard work will have a big impact for an urgent cause.
